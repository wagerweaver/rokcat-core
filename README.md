## 🧠 What Is ROKCAT?

**ROKCAT** is a modular, semi-automated crypto arbitrage infrastructure built to identify and execute cross-exchange and cross-chain opportunities with real-time speed and capital resilience. It includes:

- Multi-hop route identification  
- Pre-trade validation and risk safeguards  
- Wallet-based execution with bridging logic  
- Post-trade logging, feedback, and cold-exit fallback handling

ROKCAT is structured for long-term scalability and full automation.  
Each layer of the system is designed for **clean modularity**, **testability**, and **production-readiness**.

## 🧱 System Architecture Overview

**Pipeline Flow:**  
Scanner → Signal Filter → Loop Validator → Bridge Router (if needed) → External Wallet Executor → Strategic Buy Logic (if no immediate route) → Trade Execution → Logging / Feedback Engine → Cold Exit Engine (if failure detected)

Each of the following components has its own technical guide and implementation blueprint.

## 📦 Blueprint Index

| Module | Description | GitHub Folder |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| **1. Loop Validator** | Validates full arbitrage loops for integrity before execution | [`/loop_validator`](https://github.com/wagerweaver/rokcat-core/tree/main/loop_validator) |
| **2. Triplet Scanner** | Detects 3-step routes across tokens or exchanges | [`/triplet_scanner`](https://github.com/wagerweaver/rokcat-core/tree/main/triplet_scanner) |
| **3. Bridge Router** | Selects optimal L1–L2 bridge with fallback & latency scoring | [`/bridge_router`](https://github.com/wagerweaver/rokcat-core/tree/main/bridge_router) |
| **4. Cold Exit Engine** | Safe unwind mechanism when routes break mid-execution | [`/cold_exit_engine`](https://github.com/wagerweaver/rokcat-core/tree/main/cold_exit_engine) |
| **5. Logging & Review Layer** | Trade logging, postmortem review, and feedback integration | [`/review_layer`](https://github.com/wagerweaver/rokcat-core/tree/main/review_layer) |
| **6. External Wallet Executor** | Executes trades from external wallets with gas verification | [`/external_wallet_executor`](https://github.com/wagerweaver/rokcat-core/tree/main/external_wallet_executor) |
| **7. Signal Integrity Engine** | Filters out false, risky, or low-trust trade signals | [`/signal_integrity_engine`](https://github.com/wagerweaver/rokcat-core/tree/main/signal_integrity_engine) |
| **8. Strategic Value Module** | Discount-buy strategy when no exit is immediately available | [`/strategic_value_module`](https://github.com/wagerweaver/rokcat-core/tree/main/strategic_value_module) |

## 🌱 Roadmap Ahead

- [ ] Live execution sandbox + testing harness  
- [ ] Arbitrage opportunity memory bank (caching + ranking)  
- [ ] Dynamic route scanner expansion (4-step logic)  
- [ ] Real-time bridge benchmarker  
- [ ] Seed round investor-ready data room

# ðŸ”Ž Signal Integrity Engine

The Signal Integrity Engine filters and scores raw arbitrage signals before execution â€” protecting ROKCAT from false positives, low-liquidity traps, or high-risk assets.

It combines configurable rules, token watchlists, and scoring logic to dynamically suppress or rerank unreliable opportunities.

# ðŸŒ‰ Bridge Router

The Bridge Router powers intelligent cross-chain bridging for arbitrage execution. It integrates with external providers like Squid, Stargate, and Wormhole, dynamically selecting the optimal route based on latency, fees, and reliability.

Includes fallback logic, quote scoring, and a plug-in interface to external executors.

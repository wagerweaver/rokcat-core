# ðŸ§Š Cold Exit Engine

The Cold Exit Engine serves as ROKCATâ€™s capital defense layer â€” designed to gracefully unwind broken arbitrage loops when conditions shift mid-execution. It monitors real-time risk signals and safely routes capital out of compromised trades using a structured rollback framework.

Supports actions like re-selling, neutral bridging, partial exits, or hold-and-monitor fallback states.
